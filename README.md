# FischAutoShake
This is a AHK script for the roblox game Fisch that automatically clicks the shakes on your screen, I made this awhile ago and decided to go public with it so enjoy.



#-- First-time setup:

[1] Download AutoHotkey by going to "https://www.autohotkey.com/" and downloading the software.

[2] After you have downloaded AutoHotkey, download the script. It will appear in your downloads as a folder. It is suggested that you drag the folder to your desktop for easier access.

[3] After you have dragged it to your desktop, open the folder and click on the "fisch" file (a paper with an H on it).                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                     
[4] After clicking on the "fisch" file, a GUI should pop up. Click on settings and do the following:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
          A. Press reset to defaults.

          B. Change the keybind to your liking (default is Left Control, usually labeled as "Ctrl" on a keyboard).

          C. Change the resolution to your monitor's resolution. You NEED to do this; otherwise, it WILL NOT WORK.
                                                            
                                                                                                                                           
#-- Next, you need to take a screenshot. Doing this correctly is extremely important because it will run extremely slow if you do this wrong.

[1] Cast your rod and take a CROPPED screenshot of a letter in the shake button(H works best). A simple way to do this is by pressing "Win + Shift + S".
                                                                                                                                                                          
[2] After you successfully take a screenshot, click the popup in the bottom right to "Edit" it and make sure you click Save (I suggest saving it to Downloads or somewhere easy for you to find).

[3] Go back to the GUI and click "Select Image" to select the screenshot you took.

[4] Go back to the "Main" tab and click Save Settings. ╱|、

Whenever you launch the fisch script in the future, make sure you click Load Settings.
